Most of it should be fine: the main hacky technique I use is passing constructor arguments in an array to a generic class, to construct a class of the specified type. Confusing! This can be found in the Speak class (complicated), or the SynchronisedWait class (simple) (both in scripts/OBT/Characters/Generic).
